## Countdown Clock

Use this app to create infinite session lengths. As soon as a timer runs out, it automatically switches to the break length and resumes counting down. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Thanks to [Alex Khismatulin](https://github.com/alexkhismatulin) for creating the [react countdown hook](https://github.com/alexkhismatulin/react-use-count-down#readme)
